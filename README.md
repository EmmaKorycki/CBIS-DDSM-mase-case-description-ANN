# CBIS-DDSM-mase-case-description-ANN
This Jupyter Notebook utilizes the CBIS-DDSM mass-case-description dataset. I visualized the BI-RADS assesment score in pathology(malignant, benignm benign without callback), as well as count of malignant cases according to mass features. I utilize an ANN model to predict probability of malignancy given breast mass features. A slide presentation is attatched to provide more context into this project.
