# CBIS-DDSM-mase-case-description-ANN
This Jupyter Notebook utilizes the CBIS-DDSM mass-case-description dataset. It plots the correlation for numerical features of mass abnormalities(breast density, abnormality id, assessment, and subtlety). It also utilizes an ANN model to predict probability of malignancy given breast mass features.
